        'UBC scientist Suzanne Simard coined the terms “Mothertrees” and the “Wood Wide Web” when she discovered that trees and their roots are connected through an underground network of mushrooms. These fungal webs allow trees to pass food, medicines and messages to each other. The chemicals trees use to communicate are identical to the neurotransmitters in the human brain.',
        'Mothertrees help their saplings survive in an ever-changing climate. When a tree falls in the forest, it feeds the next generations of trees for up to five times its age.  Fallen big trees often become nurse logs and you see young trees growing out of them. The urban ecosystem creates “natural infrastructure” that builds resilience to climate change. Biodiversity like birds, insects, and other critters depend on urban forest ecosystems for their habitat. The forested greenspaces act as pathways to forests outside the city limits.',
        'Big trees and old growth forests are important because they are able to provide ecosystem services like: creating habitat, water storage and filtration, wind buffering, carbon drawdown, bank stabilization, dispersing seismic waves, clean air, and storing carbon at a scale that small trees cannot.',
        'Particularly in this time of climate crisis, it is incredibly important to maintain forests. We can only hope that in this crisis, the increasing number of climate impacts are a wake-up call for us to realize that we are part of Nature and our health and safety depends on vital and working ecosystems.',
        'It is important to find out who is responsible for planting and looking after trees in urban areas. Now, with the combination of pollution, increasing population and climate change, there is a lot of pressure on urban areas. It is crucial to look after the health of these trees because they are now stressed.',
        'Research shows that anyone who spends at least 2 hours in Nature a week can improve their mental, emotional, and physical health. Nature can boost your confidence immune system and brainpower. Science is still catching up with what Indigenous peoples have known forever: we are made of the same stuff and we are all related. Lets keep Nature close and our connection strong.',
