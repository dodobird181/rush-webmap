Many pollinators are facing extinction around the globe due to development and fragmentation of habitat, absence of food, pesticides (neonicotinoids), invasive species, general pollution and climate change.

Twenty five kilometres of continuous soil in the city is hard to find so when a tree calls in the city, does it make a sound?',

        'When a tree falls in the forest, it feeds the next generations of trees for up to five times its age. Big trees and old growth forests are also important because they are able to provide ecosystem services like: creating habitat, water storage and filtration, wind buffering, carbon drawdown, bank stabilization, dispersing seismic waves, clean air, and storing carbon at a scale that small trees cannot.',
        'Particularly in this time of climate crisis, it is incredibly important to maintain forests. We can only hope that in this crisis, the increasing number of climate impacts are a wake-up call for us to realize that we are part of Nature and our health and safety depends on vital and working ecosystems. The chemicals trees use to communicate are similar to the neurotransmitters in the human brain and we know how nice it is when we have good word retrieval and can remember people’s names.',
