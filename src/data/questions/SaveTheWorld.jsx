Resilience comes from the strength of these connections, and the collective solutions that then emerge.',

Through policy and regulations, they require businesses to consider people and the planet, and support them in creating innovative solutions. Governments can build partnerships for impact and create public value. They get their platform from what matters to the public, giving us enormous power to shape decision-making, but only when we choose to make our voices heard even when we may feel shocked into silence by discouraging news - like the Federal Court’s November 2023.',

As we urgently move towards more sustainable ways of living, we have an opportunity to dismantle the systems that have caused harm and rebuild in ways that support thriving communities in alignment with the natural world. It is essential that we take our lead from Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems. Reconciliation and broader equity goals are possible when we reject forced choices between economy and environment in favour of solutions that value a quality of life for all.',
        'Southern Vancouver Island is a traditional wintering ground for the lək̓ʷəŋən and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples because it was bountiful and protected. Vancouver Island is still considered lush by comparison to other parts of the world, but this sense of abundance can create the impression that Nature will handle it when humans intervene with old growth logging or salmon farms. In fact, our Coastal Douglas Fir ecosystem is considered critically endangered as a result of development pressures, recent climate change events, and resource extraction/interventions.',
